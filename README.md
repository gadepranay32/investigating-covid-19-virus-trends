COVID-19 Trends Analysis
This project analyzes COVID-19 case trends using global time-series data from the Johns Hopkins University repository. The analysis includes preprocessing, visualizing, and comparing trends across different countries.

Features
Dynamic Data Fetching: Downloads up-to-date COVID-19 data directly from the Johns Hopkins GitHub repository.
Data Preprocessing: Converts raw data into a clean format suitable for time-series analysis.
Trend Analysis: Examines trends in total confirmed cases over time for specific countries.
Comparative Visualization: Compares COVID-19 trends across multiple countries using line graphs.
Prerequisites
Software
R: Ensure R is installed on your system.
RStudio (optional but recommended): For running and visualizing the code interactively.
R Libraries
Install the required libraries using the following command:

R
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "httr"))
Project Files
covid19_trends_analysis.R: The main script containing the code for data download, preprocessing, and visualization.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
How to Run
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-trends-analysis.git
Run the Script:
Open covid19_trends_analysis.R in R or RStudio.
Execute the script step-by-step or all at once to perform the analysis.
Customize Analysis:
Modify the country names in the script (e.g., India, USA, Brazil) to analyze trends for your regions of interest.
Data Source
This project uses COVID-19 time-series data from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 GitHub repository: CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Sample Outputs
COVID-19 Trends for a Single Country:
Line graph showing total confirmed cases over time for a selected country.
Comparative Trends:
Multi-line graph comparing case trends for multiple countries (e.g., India, USA, Brazil).
Example Visualizations
Trend for India

Comparative Trends

Note: Replace these placeholders with actual visualization images after running the script.
